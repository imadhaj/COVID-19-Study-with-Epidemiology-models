# COVID-19-Study-with-Epidemiology-models

In this project, we are going to Study COVID-19 with Epidemiology models, based on 3 model:
- SIR model 
- SIER Model 
- Modified SEIRD model considering quarantine lockdown (SEIRD-Q)  

This notebook presents a simple "study", more like as an exercise, of how a data conciliation can be performed on Epidemiology models. This kind of approach can be adapted for other cases that have Dynamical Systems as mathematical model Contents :

Importing library
Loading Data from :

Data cleaning/ Data preprocing (global data visualization / comparison between results from Algeria and Morocco)
Programming SIR/SEIR-based models in Python ( you will find a pdf explaining the methods with this file)
Predictions
Source: This study is done by Diego Volpato (https://www.kaggle.com/volpatto) on different countries. I tried to adapt the methods on the Morocco dataset, and to implement the epidemiology models on our case.

Interesting remark : COVID-19 is a real thing, don't propagate results and data as conclusive if YOU ARE NOT A SPECIALIST IN THE FIELD.
